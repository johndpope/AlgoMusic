Compile Music.java  

To run:  
java Music  

Then type one of the genre's to hear an on-the-spot composition!  

The program takes one of the midi files, depending on the genre,  
it parses the midi data using JFugue, and then it constructs a  
simple Markov model. Then it samples from the Markov model and  
makes Java sing the notes.
